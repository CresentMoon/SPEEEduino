## SPEEEduino Official Documentation

The SPEEEduino (SP-EEE-duino, pronounced speed-duino) is an Open Source, modified Arduino board with an integrated ESP8266-01 Wi-Fi module socket, allowing for users to connect both devices with ease. The ESP8266 enables the Arduino to connect to the Internet with Wi-Fi, making this a great starting platform for simple IoT devices and projects.
